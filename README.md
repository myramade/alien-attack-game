Alien Attack is a game I created using Scatch, block coding software. The game has a simple storyline, graphics, sounds, and motion. 
I'll walk you through the elements of the game, feel free to use the files provided (***just remember to provide attribution***) or create your own graphics and game.  

**The inspiration for the game is the movie: [Gravity](https://youtu.be/OiTiKOy59o4)

Tools I used: 
- [Canva](http://canva.com) to create backgrounds and sprite graphics
- [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) to edit and convert audio to mp3
- [Astronaut Voice app](https://appgrooves.com/ios/584369584/astronaut-voice/qneo) to create the space audio for the gam
- [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) to build the game
- [Htmlifier](https://sheeptester.github.io/htmlifier/) to convert my scratch file to an html viewable and playable file

Let's get started. 

## STORYBOARD
Every game starts with an idea. I started by creating a game journal for Alien Attack. In the journal out wrote out the description of the game.

After I wrote out my game journal, I created a storyboard using [Mural](http://mural.co)

## GRAPHICS
Once I had a storyboard it was time to create graphics. I decided I wanted to use Pixel graphics. I used [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) and stock graphics. I started by creating the backdrops for the game, I created a canvas that is 490 x 360 px the backdrops consisted of a the title screen and blank backdrops screen using a space theme. You can [access the graphics here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFFa6qkJdI/2McFcdiMdbF87_xYTCh2wA/view?utm_content=DAFFa6qkJdI&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton)

Then I create a handful of grpahics I would use a Sprites for the game. Sprites are just characters create a new canvas sized to 250 x 250 px. I then searched for the graphics I needed, putting one graphic per page. Then I downloaded the graphics as transparent background PNG files.
