# ALIEN ATTACK GAME

Alien Attack is a game I created using Scatch, block coding software. The game has a simple storyline, graphics, sounds, and motion. 
I'll walk you through the elements of the game, feel free to use the files provided (just remember to provide attribution) or create your own. 

Let's get started. 

## STORYBOARD
Every game starts with an idea. I started by creating a game journal for Alien Attack. In the journal out wrote out the description of the game.

After I wrote out my game journal, I created a storyboard.
